Chapter 4

=>Modelling is as much as art then science
=>Successful time proven models and methodologies: optimization, decision analysis, decision trees, analytic hierachy process, search        methods, heuristics and simulation.
=> Models incorporated into DSS contribute to organizational success.
=> simulation models enhances org decision making process and enable it to see impacts of future choices.
=> Modelling is the key element in most DSS and a necessity in a model based DSS.
=> There are many classes of models and there are many 
=> Generating model is based on algorithms 
=> Demand forecasting model is bsaed on statistics
=> Distribution center model uses aggregate model
=> Financial and risk simulation model uses qualitative factors
=> Mathematical model is a system of symbols and expressions representing a real situation
=> Current Modelling Issues:
=> Influence models are graphical models of mathematical models
=> Cognitive map is the more general form of influence diagram
=> forecasting is predicting the future
